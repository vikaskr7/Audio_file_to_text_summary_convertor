In this project, I had build a system that can automatically recognize speech and summarize it. This can be used for automatically transcribing and summarizing lecture recordings, podcasts, or videos.

It also include a way to hook up a microphone to automatically record and transcribe audio for live notetaking. This could be used to record and transcribe meetings in real-time.
